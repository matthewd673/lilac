![.NET workflow](https://github.com/matthewd673/lilac/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)

Lilac is a little intermediate language (Lilac IL) and compiler for the IL.
It currently targets Wasm and features a number of small optimizations and analyses with more on the way.
Lilac was originally written in Ruby and was recently rewritten in C#, some features and tests are still being
translated.
